Notes from the Dec 2015 meeting

- "long" args are being promoted to "int"

- we need to examine the ramifications to:
  - PMPI / tool interception
  - Do we want to allow C++ polymorphism?
    --> does this have ramifications for pmpi tools?

- what about functions that take 2 (or 3!) counts!
  - idea: only allow (int,int) and (count,count) -- not (int,count), etc.

- need a standardized suffix for the pmpi tools to intercept
  - possibly "_x"

Does the forum want this to continue?

a consequence: this will force MPI implementations to be internally
count-safe.  Yay!
--> We should do a poll of the MPI implementations.

straw vote:
- yes: n-2
- abstain: 1
- 1 more who didn't pay attention
